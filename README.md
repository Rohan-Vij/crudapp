# A Basic CRUD app

I noticed that quite a few hackathon projects use a technology called CRUD - create, read, update, and delete. <br>
Recreating a whole CRUD application each time you make a project can quickly get boring and time intensive. <br>
So, I decided to make a barebones CRUD application which can use store images to help speed up anyone's development time.
